# Caesar Cipher - Python CLI

##  Overview

This project is a command-line implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher** encryption technique using Python.  
The program allows users to encode or decode a given text by shifting the alphabet by a user-specified number.

The program also:
- Handles spaces, symbols, and numbers without crashing.
- Allows repeated encoding/decoding operations without restarting manually.
- Imports and displays a logo from a separate `art.py` file.

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3

##  How to Use

1. Run the `cipher.py` file (or your main Python file).
2. Choose whether you want to `encode` or `decode`.
3. Enter the message text.
4. Enter the shift number (e.g., 5).
5. View the encoded or decoded output!
6. Choose to continue or exit the program.

##  Files

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `cipher.py` | Main script handling cipher logic |
| `art.py` | Contains logo text art displayed at program start |

---

##  Features

- Supports both **encoding** and **decoding** modes
- Handles non-alphabetic characters correctly
- Allows restarting the cipher without exiting
- Modular code with clear function separation

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add option to encrypt entire files.
- Add upper/lowercase handling separately.
- Add a GUI version using Tkinter or Web interface.
